Welcome to my homepage! I am Li Yunai(李云艾) and I am in [Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en/about/overview) (class 2025) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics. 

My primary research interests lie in Machine Learning theory and Optimization , with a particular focus
on developing computationally efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees. I am now a visiting student at NYU [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), and I am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Qi Lei](https://cecilialeiqi.github.io/)

I’m enthusiastic about exploring the related areas and would be excited to discuss about further
opportunities (for 25fall phd) if you see the potential!
