**Project Overview**

- Designed VAE and GAN models for high-dimensional icing image prediction from icing-condition data of aircraft wings. Enhanced the models with techniques like batch normalization and WGAN.
- Achieved better detail preservation (e.g., ice horn) in generated images, though challenges with boundary smoothness were noted.
