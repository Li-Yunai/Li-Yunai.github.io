**Project Overview**

- Designed VAE and GAN models for high-dimensional icing image prediction from icing-condition data of aircraft wings. Enhanced the models with techniques like batch normalization and WGAN.Explored neural encoding in balanced and unbalanced spiking neural networks (SNNs) for image
reconstruction; implemented data-driven models (U-Net, VAE) to decode spike trains into images.
- Analyzed performance variations brought by the balance of snn across MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
