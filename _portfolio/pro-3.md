**Project Overview**

- Used Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the Helmholtz equation in various fields (Propagation
medium), addressing both forward and inverse problems.
- Empirically Analyzed the impact of sampling, field smoothness, and dimensions on solution accuracy. Simulated
and discussed the effects of noises on PINN solutions.
