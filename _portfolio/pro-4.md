**Project Overview**

- Conducted feature engineering on a large-scale real-world dataset of air ticket purchasing behaviors.
- Developed a multinomial logit model and integrated optimization methods (line-search/trust-region) for utility
functions. Quantified variable influence and evaluated algorithmsâ€™ convergence with numerical optimization
theory.
