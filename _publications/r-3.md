**Project Overview**

- Integrated Echo State Networks (ESNs) into reinforcement learning frameworks (policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic) to develop novel algorithms, leveraging ESNs' universal approximation capabilities to improve performance and generalization on complex tasks.
- Enhanced ESN-based algorithms with advanced reinforcement learning techniques (e.g., PPO, SAC, DQN), outperforming traditional architectures (LSTM, MLP) in terms of optimization stability and gradient-free updates.
- Explored the general least-squares TD (LSTD) algorithm through the lens of ESNs, examining how ESNs' dynamics can optimize TD learning, enhance sample efficiency, and address stability challenges in value-based reinforcement learning.
- Conducted rigorous asymptotic and finite-time analyses of the Actor-Critic with ESN algorithms, demonstrating superior convergence rates and sample efficiency, highlighting ESNsâ€™ inherent regularization benefits in complex environments.
